This quickstart guide was created using the following technologies:

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/es/java/javase/downloads/index.html "Java")

##Instalation

1. Install IntelliJIDEA
2. Learn some git basics [here](https://try.github.io/)
2. Install git [https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download)
3. Clone the project in your desired folder: `git clone https://github.com/LearnByKebS/selenium.git`
4. Browse the branches and checkout the one you want to give it a try.
5. To run a test just right-click on a test and choose: run.

##Notes and recomendations

* Do not use any GUI client for git until you learn how to use it correctly by command line.
* You can choose any IDE but IntelliJIDEA kick ass :)
* In my oppinion git bash is the best commandline tools for windows. Use it.
